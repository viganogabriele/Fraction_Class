FractionClass is an algorithm that implements a Fraction class in C#, with its properties and operations. A fraction is a rational number that represents the ratio between two integers, called numerator and denominator. The Fraction class has two properties: N and D, which store the numerator and denominator of the fraction. The Fraction class also supports several operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and negation, which are defined by using the operator overloading feature of C#. The algorithm also includes a static method called CalculateGCD, which returns the greatest common divisor between two fractions, and a non-static method called Simplify, which returns an equivalent fraction but reduced to lowest terms.

The algorithm is written in C#, an object-oriented and cross-platform programming language. To run the algorithm, you need to have the .NET Framework1 or the .NET Core2 installed on your system. Moreover, you need to have an IDE or a text editor that supports the C# language, such as Visual Studio3, Visual Studio Code or MonoDevelop.

To use the algorithm, follow these steps:

- Clone or download the GitHub repository of the project.
- Open the file Program.cs with your IDE or text editor.
- Compile and run the code.
- Create two Fraction objects with the desired values for N and D.
- Perform the desired operations on the Fraction objects, such as adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing, or negating them.
- Print the results of the operations, such as the new Fraction object, the scalar value, or the simplified fraction.

The algorithm is distributed under the MIT license, which allows the use, modification and distribution of the code to anyone, as long as the same license is maintained and the authorship of the original author is recognized. The algorithm is based on the concept of fractions, which is a common topic in mathematics, algebra, and geometry.
